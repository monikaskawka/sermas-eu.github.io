# Application deployment

The application consists of seven docker containers:
- [3dify-makehuman](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/isislab/3dify-makehuman/general): The container that executes a customized version of MakeHuman that permits to elaborate the sliders value extracted from a photo into a rendered 3D avatar.
- [3dify-unity](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/isislab/3dify-unity/general): The container which starts a simple python HTTP web server which hosts the WebGL application for the avatar preview
- [3dify-python](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/isislab/3dify-python/general): Container containing the logic behind the conversion between facial landmarks and MakeHuman â€™s parameters, as well as the logic connecting the application to MakeHuman for sending new sliders value and for exporting and downloading the final 3D model .FBX file.
- [filestore](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio): Container including MinIO, an object storage application compatible with the Amazon S3 API
- [3dify](https://hub.docker.com/r/isislab/3dify-auth): Containers based on this image start the web application for the avatar management front-end.
- [mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo): Container including MongoDB, an open-source document-oriented database based on NoSQL.
- [mongo-express](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/saniewski/mongo-express-docker-extension): Extension that allows to connect to any (local or remote) MongoDB server without having to install Mongo Express locally.

The deployment of these containers is coordinated by the [Docker Compose](https://github.com/isislab-unisa/3dify/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) configuration file.
